        h2.title We've built a decentralized P2P loan economy on the blockchain.
        .description
          p Traditional loans are inflexible and inaccessible to most people in 2021. DeFi has proven there is a working use-case in decentralizing such financial services.
          p However, blockchain comes with anonymity and removes trusted third-parties, which limits the types of loans that can be issued. Why? Because some people are more likely to pay back a loan than others.
          p Trust and reputation still matters when issuing loans.
          p DeFi For You solves this by building an irrefutable, verifiable reputation system onto the blockchain and tying it together with decentralized finance services.
          p The result is a peer-to-peer loan economy, whereby lenders can trivially repossess collateral via smart contracts.
          p Now, for the first time, P2P loans can be issued to anyone, regardless of their reputation.
