      <li><p>Defining cryptoassets There is no single, widely-agreed definition of a cryptoasset.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A cryptoasset is understood to be a digital representation of value or contractual rights that can be
          transferred, stored or traded electronically, and which may (though does not necessarily) utilise cryptography,
          distributed ledger technology or similar technology.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Broadly, a cryptoasset is a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights
          that uses some type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and can be transferred, stored or traded
          electronically.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This is the approach taken to defining cryptoassets for the purposes of the UK’s Money Laundering and
          Terrorist Financing regulations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          Examples of cryptoassets include Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market is constantly evolving, with new and
          different cryptoassets being developed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The term ‘token’ is used interchangeably with ‘cryptoasset’ hereafter.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In 2019 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published its ‘Guidance on cryptoassets’ which described
          three broad categories of token in relation to how they fit within existing FCA regulation: e-money tokens,
          security tokens and unregulated tokens.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          e-money tokens meet the definition of electronic money in the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs) –
          broadly, digital payment instruments that store value, can be redeemed at par value, at any time and offer
          holders a direct claim on the issuer • security tokens have characteristics akin to specified investments, like
          a share or a debt instrument, as set out in UK legislation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Broadly, these are likely to be tokenised, digital forms of traditional securities.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As with emoney tokens, these are already within the UK’s regulatory perimeter and therefore subject to FCA
          regulation • unregulated tokens are neither e-money tokens nor security tokens and include: • utility tokens:
          tokens used to buy a service, or access a DLT platform – this could, for example, include access to online cloud
          storage; and • exchange tokens: tokens that are primarily used as a means of exchange – this includes widely
          known cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, Ether and XRP.
        </p>

          ‘as assets, they establish no claim on any future income streams or collateral. They have no intrinsic
          value beyond their currently limited potential to be adopted as money in the future, and hence could prove
          worthless’.
